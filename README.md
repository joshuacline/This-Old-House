 ***What to Do When Facing a Bug Problem***
- Document Everything: Take photos/videos of pests, infestations, and keep record of personal damages.
- Give Written Notice: Send a formal, written (or electronic) notice to your landlord detailing the infestation and referencing your rights, as per local laws (like Colorado's HB19-1328 for bed bugs).
- Know Your Local Laws: Landlord responsibilities vary; check your state/city laws (e.g., Colorado requires landlords to inspect within 96 hours of bed bug notice).
- Warranty of Habitability: Landlords must maintain safe, habitable conditions.

 ***Common Landlord Failures & Tenant Recourse***
- Landlord must inspect within 96 hours and develop a plan; failure makes the unit uninhabitable.
- Ignoring Other Pests: For mice or roaches, if the condition makes the unit unsafe, the landlord must act under the Warranty of Habitability.
- Liability for Damages: A negligent landlord can be liable for tenant's physical/emotional distress, lost wages, and property loss.
